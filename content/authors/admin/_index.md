I am currently working on my MD thesis project in the lab of Prof. Dr. Frederik Damm in the Department of Hematology/Oncology at the Virchow Campus of the Charite – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. My project aims to elucidate novel genetic lesions in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) which is a rare lymphoma entity.
