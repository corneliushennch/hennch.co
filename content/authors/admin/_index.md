I am psychiatry resident in the department of psychiatry of the Charité at the St. Hedwig hospital in Berlin. I am currently completing my MD thesis project in the lab of Prof. Dr. Frederik Damm at the Department of Hematology/Oncology at the Virchow Campus of the Charité. During my thesis project, I discovered my interest and passion for reproducible data analysis and visualization with R.
