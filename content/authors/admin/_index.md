In fall 2021 I started my residency training in psychiatry at the department of psychiatry of the Charité at the St. Hedwig hospital in Berlin. I am still working on my MD thesis project in the lab of Prof. Dr. Frederik Damm in the Department of Hematology/Oncology at the Virchow Campus of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. My project aims to elucidate novel genetic lesions in a rare lymphoma entity. As I want to analyse the data in the most reproducible way, I am pushing myself to learn and apply a variety of tools for reproducible data analysis.
