I am currently working on my MD thesis project in the lab of Prof. Dr. Frederik Damm in the Department of Hematology/Oncology at the Virchow Campus of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. My project aims to elucidate novel genetic lesions in a rare lymphoma entity. In the first part of my project I created single-cell derived knock-out models that we subsequently analyzed with a variety of functional assays as well as omics methods. I am currently working on the comprehensive analysis of the clinical as well as molecular data of our patient cohort. As I want to analyse the data in the most reproducible way, I am pushing myself to learn and apply a variety of tools for reproducible data analysis.
