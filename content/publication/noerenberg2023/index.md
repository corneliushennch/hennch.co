abstract: "**Purpose:** Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a rare aggressive lymphoma predominantly affecting young female patients. Large-scale genomic investigations and genetic markers for risk stratification are lacking. <br><br>

**Patients and methods:** To elucidate the full spectrum of genomic alterations, samples from 340 patients with previously untreated PMBCL were investigated by whole-genome (n = 20), whole-exome (n = 78), and targeted (n = 308) sequencing. Statistically significant prognostic variables were identified using a multivariable Cox regression model and confirmed by L1/L2 regularized regressions. <br><br>

**Results:** Whole-genome sequencing revealed a commonly disrupted p53 pathway with nonredundant somatic structural variations (SVs) in *TP53*-related genes (*TP63*, *TP73*, and *WWOX*) and identified novel SVs facilitating immune evasion (DOCK8 and CD83). Integration of mutation and copy-number data expanded the repertoire of known PMBCL alterations (eg, *ARID1A*, *P2RY8*, and *PLXNC1*) with a previously unrecognized role for epigenetic/chromatin modifiers. Multivariable analysis identified six genetic lesions with significant prognostic impact. *CD58* mutations (31%) showed the strongest association with worse PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.52 [95% CI, 1.50 to 4.21]; P < .001) and overall survival (HR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.14 to 4.76]; P = .02). IPI high-risk patients with mutated *CD58* demonstrated a particularly poor prognosis, with 5-year PFS and OS rates of 41% and 58%, respectively. The adverse prognostic significance of the *CD58* mutation status was predominantly observed in patients treated with nonintensified regimens, indicating that dose intensification may, to some extent, mitigate the impact of this high-risk marker. By contrast, *DUSP2*-mutated patients (24%) displayed durable responses (PFS: HR, 0.2 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.55]; P = .002) and prolonged OS (HR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.78]; P = .028). Upon CHOP-like treatment, these patients had very favorable outcome, with 5-year PFS and OS rates of 93% and 98%, respectively.<br><br>

**Conclusion:** This large-scale genomic characterization of PMBCL identified novel treatment targets and genetic lesions for refined risk stratification. *DUSP2* and *CD58* mutation analyses may guide treatment decisions between rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone and dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab.
