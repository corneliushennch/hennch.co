abstract: Recent exome-wide studies discovered frequent somatic mutations in the epigenetic modifier *ZNF217* in primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and related disorders. As functional consequences of *ZNF217* alterations remain unknown, we comprehensively evaluated their impact in PMBCL. Targeted sequencing identified genetic lesions affecting *ZNF217* in 33% of 157 PMBCL patients. Subsequent gene expression profiling (n = 120) revealed changes in cytokine and interferon signal transduction in *ZNF217*-aberrant PMBCL cases. In vitro, knockout of *ZNF217* led to changes in chromatin accessibility interfering with binding motifs for crucial lymphoma-associated transcription factors. This led to disturbed expression of interferon-responsive and inflammation-associated genes, altered cell behavior, and aberrant differentiation. Mass spectrometry demonstrates that ZNF217 acts within a histone modifier complex containing LSD1, CoREST and HDAC and interferes with H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation. Concluding, our data suggest non-catalytic activity of ZNF217, which directs histone modifier complex function and controls B cell differentiation-associated patterns of chromatin structure.
